## Overview

This simulator models satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and evaluates their visibility over military bases. It is designed for:

- **Mission planning** (e.g., communications, imaging, or weather observation)
- **Base coverage analysis** (pass counts and coverage gaps)
- **Educational or professional demonstration** of orbital mechanics

---

## Features

- Customize altitude, inclination, and number of satellites
- Visualize orbits and coverage areas on an interactive 3D globe (Cesium.js)
- Filter and analyze U.S. military bases by branch or region
- Displays analytics like:
  - Pass counts per base
  - Longest gap in coverage
  - Redundancy index
